  * A callback function is a function that is passed into another function as a parameter then invoked by that other function
  * A higher order function is a function that accepts a callback as a parameter
  * findIndex is a function that returns the index of the first element in the array for which the callback returns a truthy value. -1 is returned if the callback never returns a truthy value. 
  * Stack and Heap: 
      * Stack is and ordered set of stack frames, most recent recently invoked at the top, the first invoked at bottom, processed from top to bottom:
          * An ordered data structure
