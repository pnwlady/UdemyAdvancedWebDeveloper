### Async Foundations
 * A callback function is a function that is passed into another function as a parameter then invoked by that other function
 * A higher order function is a function that accepts a callback as a parameter
 * findIndex is a function that returns the index of the first element in the array for which the callback returns a truthy value. -1 is returned if the callback never returns a truthy value.
